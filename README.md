# My Quickshell Dots ⚙️

## Why This Repo Exists 🤔

Okay, so let's be real: this isn't a showcase of meticulously crafted dotfiles. This repository is more like a digital safety net for my Quickshell configuration. 😅

I'm still trying to wrap my head around how everything is set up, so this is mostly a backup in case I accidentally nuke my system or lose access to my GitHub account. 🤷‍♀️

## Expectation Management 🚧

Don't expect groundbreaking customization here. For the foreseeable future, these dots will likely be _heavily inspired_ (read: almost identical) to the glorious work of [end-4](https://github.com/end-4). I'm just trying not to lose my setup! 😂
